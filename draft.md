.question[
# Sorry, I lied
You can still get runtime exceptions
]

If you use Javascript.

---

class: center, middle

.question[
# What is a runtime exception?
]

exception thrown if an error which can only be found on runtime occurs

---

# Runtime exception
## When it happens?
* unexpected user input (ask for a number, get a string)
* inconsistent data from external sources (missing field, invalid json...)
* bugs

---

# Bugs
## Can't I prevent bugs?
* you __should__ be able to
* [A simple JS bug](https://gist.github.com/pietro909/987d2015dbce8c89d259e2b72fa17c2a)
```javascript
    function contains(c, s) {
      var index = s.indexOf(c);
      return index > -1;
    }

    contains("h", 1); // TypeError ...
```

---

# Bugs
## Check, check, check...
* apply defensive techniques
* [check against type](https://gist.github.com/pietro909/587ff2336a92eb5357d0fd002349eaec)
```javascript
    function contains(c, s) {
      var index = typeof s === 'string' ? s.indexOf(c) : -1;
      return index > -1;
    }
```
* you are handling something weird

# Bugs
## Find the bug at compile time
* static type checking
* non-nullable types
* no implicit casts
* referential transparency

---

# Bugs
## How does Elm behave?
* doesn't compile
```elm
    contains c s =
      (List.length (String.indexes c s)) > 0

    contains "hi" 1
```

# Elm
## What is Elm
* Functional language
* Declarative
* ML-like syntax
* Statically and strongly typed

---

# Elm
## Features
* Compiles to Javascript
* Follows Elm Architecture
* Enforces semantic versioning
* Javascript interoperability

---

## Elm architecture
* Model
* Update
* View
* No plugins, libraries, ...

---

## Elm architecture
you already know this, right?
Now it is part of the language.

## No runtime exceptions
Front end code?
Elm compiles to Javascript.
Optimized Javascript.

## Interoperability
* call Elm code from JS
* use Elm global object
* bootstrap app
* send data to ports

## Ports
* runtime assertions on incoming data
* will fail immediately


> I do not expect to be compiling to JavaScript forever, especially with WebAssembly on the horizon. The smaller the interface between Elm and JS, the easier it will be to support other platforms.
[Evan Czaplicki, Farewell to FRP](http://elm-lang.org/blog/farewell-to-frp)

## Package system
* enforces semantic versioning based on the changes to your package

Evan got the idea for the language when he did an internship
at Google and realized how horrible it was to create user interfaces on the web. He was
fascinated by how CSS had been around for twenty years but still you couldnâ€™t center a box
within a box in a easy way.
